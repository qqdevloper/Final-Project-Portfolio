# Wesley Wu's Programming Portfolio

## About Me

Hello,  
My name is Wesley Wu. I'm a student programmer currently studying Computer Science. I work collaboratively with other student programmers to build applications, often taking the lead in design and concept development before contributing directly to the coding process.

During my coursework, I've learned the fundamentals of programming in C++ and JavaScript. My experience includes:
- Loops
- Function initialization
- Boolean logic (true/false conditions)
- Conditional statements

In addition to coding, we've explored foundational internet structures, though the main focus has been programming.

### 🍪 Cookie Clicker

This is a simple clicker game developed with two other student programmers. The game emphasizes **manual clicking** to collect cookies. Players must restock cookies to continue progressing. There are no automatic cookie-generating structures—just active clicking and resource management.
